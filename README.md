# Udagram Simple Frontend

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed along side the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

Instructions for deploying the Frontend and integrating it with the server can be found in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)
